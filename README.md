# Krök och Stök

React app for buying alcohol online!

<br>

## Intro

In this project we are going to build a Web-App using `React` and `TypeScript`.
In our Web-App you can add or remove different types of beers, wines and liquors in your shopping cart and then proceed to a checkout.


<br>

`disclaimer` 
(you can't actually buy these alcoholic drinks in real life, it is just a school project)  

<br>

## Setup and Running

First you need to have `Node.JS` installed on your computer for this project to work, after that you need to open up the file in `VS Code` and type in the terminal `npm i`.

After the installation is done you need to type `npm start` in the `terminal` for the project to start in the browser.
